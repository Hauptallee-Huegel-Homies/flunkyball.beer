</ol>
<h1 id=items>Items</h1>
<h2 id=drinks>Drinks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each player needs at least one container holding a drink.</li>
<li>The contents of the container are to be agreed upon by the teams.</li>
<li>No agreement results in a <em>decider</em>, the winner choosing their own drinks,
the loser may choose the same, or drinks, such that both teams have at least
the same volume in total and all players drink at least the same relative
alcohol content.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=target>Target</h2>
<ol>
<li>Any object that can be tipped over, however, does not tip over by itself, may
be the <em>target</em>, agreed upon by the teams.</li>
<li>No agreement results in a <em>decider</em>, the winner choosing the <em>target</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=throwing-object>Throwing Object</h2>
<ol>
<li>Any object can be the <em>throwing object</em>, however it must be agreed upon in
advance.</li>
<li>Should it no longer be possible to reliably tip over the <em>target</em> with the
<em>throwing object</em>, and it is beyond repair, it can be exchanged for a newly
agreed upon object.</li>
<li>No agreement results in a <em>decider</em>, the winner choosing the <em>throwing object</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id=pitch>Pitch</h1>
<ol>
<li>The <em>pitch</em> consists of:
<ol>
<li>The <em>centre</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>circle</em>, around the <em>centre</em> with the length of the shortest shoe of
all players as diameter.</li>
<li>The <em>beerlines</em>, which are equidistant from the centre, while parallel to
each other.</li>
</ol>
</li>

upside down over their head.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id=phases>Phases</h1>
<p>The game is played in turns &mdash; consisting of two phases &mdash; until the <em>match</em> ends.</p>
<h2 id=action-phase>Action Phase</h2>
<ol>
<li>All players have to remain behind their <em>beerlines</em>.</li>
<li>The containers may be repositioned, only by oneself, along the respective
<em>beerline</em>, otherwise the containers must rest on the <em>beerline</em>.</li>
<li>One of the <em>Offence</em>&rsquo;s players remaining in the game, who did not throw in
this <em>lap</em>, throws the <em>throwing object</em>, such that at the time of release
the <em>throwing object</em> is above the elbow(s) of the players throwing arm(s).</li>
<li>Upon releasing the <em>throwing object</em>, the <em>Reaction Phase</em> starts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=reaction-phase>Reaction Phase</h2>
<ol>
<li>The <em>Defence</em> may step over their <em>beerline</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>Offence</em> may start to drink if they successfully and legally used the
<em>throwing object</em> to tip over the <em>target</em>.</li>
<li>Once the <em>target</em> is repositioned within the <em>circle</em>, and all players of the
<em>Defence</em> return behind their <em>beerline</em> they may signal the <em>Offence</em> to
stop. The <em>Offence</em> must stop no later than then.</li>
<li>After all players are behind their <em>beerlines</em> and the <em>throwing object</em> is
under the control of the <em>Defence</em>, the <em>Reaction Phase</em> ends and the teams
swap roles.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=tiebreaker>Tiebreaker</h2>
<ol>
<li>If both teams do not hit the <em>target</em> for two <em>laps</em>, the <em>beerlines</em> may be
moved towards the <em>centre</em>, twice the length of the shortest shoe of the
players in the team.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id=penalties>Penalties</h1>
<ol>
<li>It is the obligation of the other team to demand penalties on rule violations
within one throw.</li>
<li>Penalties can only occur self-inflicted or due to legal actions of the other
team.</li>
<li>At the offending player&rsquo;s discretion they are allowed to choose a higher
penalty.</li>
<li>Should a penalty no longer be possible, the next higher penalty is given.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=minor>Minor</h2>
<p>In the next <em>Action Phase</em> with the offending party as <em>Offence</em>, the teams swap
roles without a throw attempt. The following actions result in a minor penalty:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leaving the <em>pitch</em>, without unanimous vote of all remaining players.</li>
<li>Stepping in front of the <em>beerline</em> as <em>Offence</em>, or during the <em>Action
Phase</em> as <em>Defence</em>.</li>
<li>Lifting the container too early during the <em>Reaction Phase</em> as <em>Offence</em>.</li>
<li>Touching the container during the <em>Reaction Phase</em> as <em>Defence</em>.</li>
<li>Touching someone else&rsquo;s drink.</li>
<li>The container tipping over without spilling drinks. The container has to be
repositioned upright immediatly, without further penalties for touching the
container.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=major>Major</h2>
<p>The offending party must take an additional drink. The drink can be delegated to
exactly one member of the team, remaining or already finished. The following
actions result in a major penalty:</p>
<ol>
<li>The container empties for any other reason than being drunk by the player.</li>
<li>The container is drank from, while the own team is not the <em>Offence</em> or it is
not the <em>Reaction Phase</em>.</li>
<li>The container is drank from, while the <em>target</em> is still standing, or after
the other team legally signaled to stop, or if the <em>target</em> was not tipped
over with a legal throw.</li>
<li>Spitting out drinks.</li>
<li>Puking.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=severe>Severe</h2>

<em>match</em>. The following action results in a severe penalty:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deliberately spilling drinks.</li>
